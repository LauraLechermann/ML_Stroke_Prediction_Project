## üìå Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning system to **predict stroke risk in patients** using clinical and demographic data. The analysis identifies key risk factors and creates a deployable **web application** for real-time stroke risk assessment. Using advanced feature engineering and model optimization, the system provides **clinically relevant predictions** to support healthcare professionals.

## üìä Dataset Overview
The dataset contains records of **5,110 patients** with stroke outcomes derived from healthcare settings.

### **Features include:**
- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Residence Type (Urban/Rural)
- **Medical History:** Hypertension, Heart Disease, BMI, Average Glucose Level
- **Lifestyle:** Smoking Status, Work Type, Marital Status
- **Target Variable:** Stroke (binary: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

### **Dataset Characteristics:**
- 4.9% stroke incidence (highly imbalanced)
- ~4% missing BMI values
- Age range: 0.08 to 82 years
- Requires careful preprocessing and resampling (SMOTE)

## ü©∫ Project Objective

Stroke is a **leading cause of death and long-term disability**. The goal of this project is to build a simple and interpretable machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a patient having a stroke based on demographic, medical, and lifestyle data.

Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for:

- Flag patients who may be at higher risk
- Understand key modifiable risk factors
- Support early screening or further clinical investigation
- Demonstrate how basic clinical data can be used for predictive modeling
- Serve as a prototype for more advanced risk assessment tools

## üîß Methodology Overview

### üî¨ Data Processing & Feature Engineering
- BMI imputation (median)
- New clinical features:
  - Age groups (young, middle-aged, senior)
  - BMI categories (underweight, normal, overweight, obese)
  - Glucose levels grouped (normal, prediabetic, high)
  - Risk factor count and interaction terms
  - BMI/glucose ratio
- One-hot encoding and scaling
- SMOTE resampling for class imbalance

### üß† Models Trained

1. **Logistic Regression (Primary Model)**
   - Interpretable, simple
   - Tuned: C=0.1, L1 penalty, class weights
   - 7 best features selected for deployment

2. **Random Forest**
   - Ensemble method trained with 100 trees (default setting)
   - Used to explore non-linear patterns and feature importance

3. **XGBoost**
   - Gradient boosting for higher performance
   - Tuned via cross-validation

### ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Selection & Optimization
- Recursive feature importance analysis
- Feature count reduced from 30 ‚ûù 7
- Only ~2% performance loss
- GridSearchCV used for hyperparameter tuning

### üìè Evaluation Metrics
- **Primary**: Recall (maximize detection of stroke cases)
- **Secondary**: Precision, F1, ROC-AUC
- Stratified train-test split (80/20)
- 5-fold cross-validation

## üöÄ Deployment (instructions see below under 'Deployment Preparation')

Streamlit web application enables **real-time prediction** in a browser:
- Intuitive form to enter patient data
- Risk classification: Low, Moderate, High, Very High
- Probability score and prediction label
- Designed for easy clinical use

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### üî¨ Analysis Environment

```bash
# Clone repository

```bash
jupyter notebook Stroke_Prediction_ML_Dev.ipynb
```
This will open the notebook in your default web browser
Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the complete analysis

To run the analysis successfully, make sure the **stroke dataset CSV** file is placed in the root project directory with the following filename in Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv')

# Basic overview
print(f"Dataset shape: {df.shape}")
df.head()
```

The analysis includes comprehensive visualizations created with functions from `stroke_functions.py`:

Example usage:
```bash
import stroke_functions as viz

# Plot feature importance
viz.plot_feature_importance(model, feature_names, model_type="linear")
```

File Structure Note: Ensure stroke_functions.py is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook for successful analysis execution.
